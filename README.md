##Web App for UIRIMAL Conference

This application was developed for the 2015 Model Arab League Conference at the International University of Rabat by myself and the Georgia State University Model UN/Model Arab League teams.

The application is powered by the KeystoneJS CMS, and is a full-stack JavaScript application (KeystoneJS, Node.js, MongoDB, Nunjucks).
